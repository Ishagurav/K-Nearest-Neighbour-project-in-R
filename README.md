# knearest - Project 1
Since KNN is such a simple algorithm, we will just use this "Project" as a simple exercise to test our understanding of the implementation of KNN.We'll use the ISLR package to get the data.
We will apply the KNN approach to the Caravan data set, which is part of the ISLR library. This data set includes 85 predictors that measure demographic characteristics for 5,822 individuals. The response variable is Purchase, which indicates whether or not a given individual purchases a Caravan insurance policy. In this data set, only 6% of people purchased caravan insurance.

# knearest2 - Project 2
We'll use the famous iris data set for this project. It's a small data set with flower features that can be used to attempt to predict the species of an iris flower.Use the ISLR libary to get the iris data set
